total height = user defined height of content + 2(padding + 2(border)

In alternative box model the total box size is the same as content width and height.

What happens in a margin collapse?
Vertical margins between 2 elements overlap and merge into 1 margin.

What happens when both margins have positive value?
size of final margin = size of largest margin between the 2.

What happens when one margin is positive and one margin is negative?
size of final margin =  positive margin + negative margin.

What happens when both margins have negative value?
size of final margin = size of smallest margin between the 2.

Do horizontal margins collapse?
No!


As good practice:
Do not modify padding, border or margins to an inline element. Change their display to inline-blocks before doing so.
Use span as generic inline container, use div as generic block container.
Use flexbox over inline-blocks.
