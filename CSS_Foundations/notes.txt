How do id, class and type selectors compare with each other in terms of specificity:
id selector > any number of class selectors
class selector > any number of type selectors
type selector > universal selector and inherited values

universal selector and inherited values have a specificity value of 0.

What determines a higher weight when all selectors are evenly matched in specificity?
higher number of selectors > lower number of selectors of the same specificity.
the source order : a later rule/declaration wins.

What are the 3 sources of style information forming a cascade?
CSS stylesheets
Browser's default styles
End-user specified styles.

What is a CSS pseudo-class?
A keyword added to the selector that gives the element special behaviour e.g.
hover which change colour when cursor passover it.

/* rule 1 */
#subsection .list {
  background-color: yellow;
  color: blue;
}

/* rule 2 */
#subsection .main .list  {
  color: red;
}

What would the background colour be?
Yellow because there's nothing in rule 2 to conflict with rule 1.

Why will paragraph here have blue text instead of red?

<div id="ancestor">
    <p class="descendant">paragraph</p>

#ancestor {
    color: red;
}

.descedant {
    color: blue;
}

When descendant class is directly selected, the inherited red colour
from ancestor id is lost.
