You can have identical class on multiple elements. e.g.

<div class="Colour"> Lorem Ipsum </div>
<p class="Colour"> Lorem Ipsum </p>
<a class="Colour" href=""> Lorem Ipsum </a>

You can have multiple class attributes for one element. e.g.
<div class="Class1 Class2 Class3"> Lorem Ipsum </div>

Refactoring CSS code:
grouping, when multiple selected elements use the same style.
chaining 
combinators, [descendant combinator, x, x, x]

What is the major difference between classes and id attribute usages?
An element can have multiple classes values but only 1 id value.

Why should you include a list of values for font-size property?
So that the browser has further options if it can't support the first font family.

What will happen if you do not explicitly state height and width for an image?
The Browser would not reserve a space on the webpage for the image.
This means the image will take a long time to load.
After the image loads, the layout of other contents will be messed up.
