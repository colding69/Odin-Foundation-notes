Explain techniques for asking programming questions:
 - Include code snippets
 - Specific number line
 - Detail chronology of what you tried
 - Ask areas to research if completely unable to start.

XY problem
When a user asks about an attempted solution without mentioning the problem he is trying to solve with it. 
Solution Y can seemingly solve problem X.
Asking how solution Y works only to find out it's not fit to solve X. Time wasted.
Always mention the big picture of why to any how.

 
Technique / checklist

1. Understand line-by-line. Take note whenever a line is not understood.
2. Use a debugger.
3. Give source to problem. i.e. URL, timestamp.
4. Explain chronology with provided code snippet. What you tried(hypothesis). What you expected. What you did not get.
5. Provide error message in full.
6. Check the extracted code snippet actually doesn't work outside of scipt.
7. Include a personal guess on why it doesn't work.
8. Proofread and spellcheck question before submitting.
9. Before thanking the answerer, verify whether their solution works.


Knowledge Check

1) Name at least one thing your question should always include.
Code Snippets

2) Describe the “XY Problem”.
Similar to a patient asking for the right course of antibiotics without mentioning he has a viral infection. 
He's asking about the solution he thinks he needs which may not be fit for the problem at hand.

3) Describe three attributes of a "help vampire."
Feeling offended at suggestions of a better approach he is inexperienced at.
Reluctance to google and research before human resource.
Asking the same question repetitively.
