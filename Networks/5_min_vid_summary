How do IP addresses and routers prevent device Y from seeing device X's information on same local network? i.e. Candyy analogy?

As request packet travels from client to server, each router it encounters adds its own IP address on top of the client's IP address. i.e. wrapping a new layer on the candy.

Server produces response packet and layers identical IP addresses on top of it.

As response packet travels from server to client, each router unwraps a layer of IP address.
