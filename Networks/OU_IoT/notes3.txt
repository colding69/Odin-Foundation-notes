What are protocol suites and what they used for?
Protocol suite: A group of inter-related protocols necessary to ensure interoperability between network devices.

Why does WWW need a common protocol suite?
IoE involves a mixture of short and long range data transmissions. 
Within a short LAN, all end devices manufactured by one Vendor could be operating under protocols specific to that vendor.
Long transmission involves data sent to devices manufactured by various geographical vendors with different protocols.
Thus IoE common protocol suite is required to ensure devices from different vendors all work in the WWW.

Protocol suite of the WWW is Transmission Control Protocol or Internet Protocol.



What is the client-server model?
A model where workload is partitioned between centralised servers and clients. 



What is the difference between Cloud-computing model and Client-server model?

Cloud-computing model have servers and services dispersed in distributed data centres instead of being centralised. 

Network edge: Interface between device or local network with internet.


How are IP addresses allocated?
Default gateway: A node in a network which forwards packets to another network when destination IP address does not match with any routes.
Default gateway IP is assigned by ISP.

IPV4 addresses are automatically assigned by Dunamic HOst Configuration Protocol / DHCPv4
IPV6 addresses are obtained from IPV6 router by Stateless Address Autoconfiguration or alternatively through Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPV6, DHCPv6


802.15 protocol devices must forward data to IP-enabled device to communicate on the internet. Examples of such devices are bluetooth-enabled, NFC etc.

How do Cloud-computing model support IoE?
Cloud-computing has synchronised data such that data from server in one data center is identical to server in another.
End users access data through applications of the cloud instead of software installed locally to end device.
e.g. Gmail vs Outlook where you can't view email without outlook app installed on pc.
An user can process data using different services without being constrained by hardware limitations or portability issues.


What is the advantage of fog computing?
Devices with sensors generate large amount of data in real time.
Inefficient to transmit all data from devices into cloud, analyze then forward decisions back to network edge.
Fog computing networks are closer to network edges and execute tasks requiring quick response before data reaches cloud.
Thereby, reducing data burden on network from too many devices.
Thus devices can operate when network connections are lost.
