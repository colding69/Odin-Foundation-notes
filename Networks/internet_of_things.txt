Describe what the internet is?
The technical infrastructure enabling a global network of computers interconnected through IP protocols and data packets. 

What is the world wide web?
World Web Web is the transmission protocol built on top of the internet.

What is a router?
A intermediary device which directs packets from origin to destination device.

Why is a router useful?
Devices within a network all connect to the router, instead of each other.
Thereby reducing number of connections and complexity in a network.
Building very large network consisting of smaller networks connected through router-router links.


What are the reasons for truncating data into 'packets' during transport on internet?
Replacing smaller packets enables corrupted data to be salvaged.
Packets from same data can be routed along different paths. 
This prevents congestion from sending whole data to one user at a time.
Allowing faster exchange and multiple users to simultaneously download website. 

Differences between webpage, website and web server?
Webpages are files displayable by a browser with an unique URL.
Website is a collection of webpages and other component files sharing unique domain name.
Web server is the computing device hosting one or more webistes.

Differences between web browser and search engine?
Search engine is a website for finding webpages.
Web browser is a software for retrieving and accessing webpages.


What is DNS server?
The address book matching website's IP address to domain name. 

What is a DNS request?
Occurs when a domain name is not locally stored in client's DNS cache.
When a browser accesses DNS server to obtain website's IP address from its domain name, in order to send request to the right server. 

Describe the procedure after a website's address is typed into browser.
Browser makes DNS request to retrieve IP address of website's server.
Browser sends HTTPrequest to server.
Server approves request and signals "200 OK" messages to client.
Client retrieves a copy of the website in packets.
Browser displays website.


Chronology of website parsing and rendering.

1) Server returns {{c1::HTML file}} in response to client request.

2) Browser {{c1::parse through HTML file}} from beginning to end.

3) A {{c1::request is initiated}} for every {{c1::CSS link}} and javascript script found within HTML.

4) Browser constructs DOM from parsed HTML to {{c1::DOM}}.

5) Browser constructs {{c1::CSSOM}}  from CSS.

6) Browser {{c1::engine}} combines {{c1::DOM}} and {{c1::CSSOM}} to create {{c1::render tree}}.

7) Browser compiles and executes Javascript scripts.

6) Browser determines {{c1::layout}} of page before {{c1::rendering it in pixels.}}




What is a client?
An computing device for making requests to servers, often connected to internet via ISPs.

What is a server?
A computing device for hosting 1 or more websites and sends responses to clients request, often connected directly to internet.

What is IP address?
Unique string of numbers assigned to each device connected to internet.



What is an ISP?
A company providing clients access to internet through managing routers network and connecting to routers of other ISPs.

LAN <--> ISP network <--> destination network
