    <h1>Mess around</h1>
    <h2>Does flex-container width(main axis length in this case) override flex-item width?</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
    </div>
    <p>RESULT: YES. If you go to experiment.css, you'll find that the black flex-container has a width of 600px.
        Both flex-items have width of 400px each, meaning their total width of 800px. The width of flex-container did not stretch
        to accomodate for the other 200px;
        Each flex-item instead shrunk to 300px wide.
    </p>
    <h2>Would this still apply if main axis was set to height instead of width?</h2>
    <div class="column-container">
        <div></div>
        <div></div>
    </div>
    <p>RESULT: YES. This time the main axis runs vertically due to column value. However, the rules are unchanged,
        the height of container did not change to accomodate an extra 100px from the combined height of the items.
