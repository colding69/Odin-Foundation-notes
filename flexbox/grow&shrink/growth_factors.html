        <p>All 3 boxes are the same size because they all have the same growth factor. i.e. 
           flex-grow is set to 1 for all of them.</p>
        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="one">growth factor 1</div>

        </div>
        <h2>Custom flex-grow values</h2>
        <p>
            Here the second grid is much wider because its growth factor is set to 2 whilst
            its neighbour's growth factors are set to 1.
